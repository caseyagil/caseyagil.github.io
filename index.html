							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>Standing in for filler.  Come on back to see what happens!</p>
							<p>I have been attending school at American Military University,
								because the military pays for the school for 5 classes per year.
								For the first few years I played around and did not utilize this
								resource.  But now I have been as much as I can, I am 12 classes
								away from obtaining my Bachelors of Science in Information
								Systems Security focusing on Digital Forensics.  Working in
								Internaional Military Corrections has shown me a lot of bad
								things people do on the Internet.  Working in the Digital
								Forensics field, I feel like I would still contribute globally
								while still playing with technology.</p>

						<!--Similar to my feedback above, I feel like this should all be under one article tag, with separate sections
						to divide the "about me" and "thoughts"-->
						<article class="bottomcontent">
							<!--Again below I would use section instead -->
							<content>
								<h2>Thoughts</h2>
								<p>When I attended our mandatory separation class
									where they teach us how to be marketable and how to
									do resumes I personally felt cheated not because they
									did not do a good job but because the material felt dated.
									I want to make the process better but need to
									learn the foundations first.</p>

						<!--The way your page is structure right now, the aside element might be used
						semantically correct, as it's not directly related to about me or thoughts, but the name of your classes
						seems off. Since the aside isn't performing as a sidebar, its in the middle of the html page, I would try to name it something else
						maybe even just "center-aside"?-->

							<h2>Coding so far...</h2>
							<p>As it stands now I have looked and watched dozens of Youtube
								videos, started with OneMonthRails, and even Udemy.  </p>
