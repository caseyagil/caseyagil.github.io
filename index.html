						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>Standing in for filler.  Come on back to see what happens!</p>
						<p>I have been attending school at American Military University,
              because the military pays for the school for 5 classes per year.
              For the first few years I played around and did not utilize this
              resource.  But now I have been as much as I can, I am 12 classes
              away from obtaining my Bachelors of Science in Information
              Systems Security focusing on Digital Forensics.  Working in
              Internaional Military Corrections has shown me a lot of bad
              things people do on the Internet.  Working in the Digital
              Forensics field, I feel like I would still contribute globally
              while still playing with technology.</p>

						<h2>Thoughts</h2>
						<p>When I attended our mandatory separation class
              where they teach us how to be marketable and how to
              do resumes I personally felt cheated not because they
              did not do a good job but because the material felt dated.
              I want to make the process better but need to
              learn the foundations first.</p>

            videos, started with OneMonthRails, and even Udemy.  </p>
